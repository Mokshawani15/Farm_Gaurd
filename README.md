# ðŸšœ Farm Security System â€“ AI-Powered Real-Time Animal Detection & Response

## Overview
This **Farm Security System** is a prototype developed to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating **real-time video analysis** with **automated response mechanisms** for farm protection.  

While functional, this prototype is **not intended for large-scale deployment** but instead showcases the **core concepts** of hardware-software integration for detecting and deterring animals from entering farm areas.

---

## System Overview
The system consists of two main components:

### **1. Hardware Module**
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller** â€“ Acts as the main IoT device for hardware control and communication.
- **Stepper Motor** â€“ Rotates the camera/mobile phone for wider surveillance coverage.
- **Buzzer & LED** â€“ Provide audible and visual alerts when animals are detected.
- **Mobile Phone** â€“ Serves as a webcam for video capture.
- **Motor Driver (L298N)** â€“ Controls stepper motor movement.

### **2. Software Module**
- Runs on **Raspberry Pi** or **PC**.
- Uses **OpenCV** for video frame processing.
- Employs a **pre-trained machine learning model** for animal detection.
- Communicates with the ESP8266 via **HTTP requests**.
- Sends **real-time alerts** to the farmer through **Telegram**.

## Prototype Workflow
1. **Video Capture**  
   - Mobile phone streams live video to a **local server**.
   
2. **Animal Detection**  
   - Raspberry Pi or PC processes video frames using **OpenCV**.
   - Pre-trained classifier identifies animals such as **deer**.
   
3. **Signal Transmission**  
   - On detection, system sends an **HTTP request** to ESP8266.
   
4. **Responsive Actions**  
   - ESP8266 activates buzzer & LED.
   - Stepper motor rotates the camera to track movement.
   - Sends **Telegram notification** to the farmer.

##  Limitations of the Prototype
- **Simulated Testing Environment** â€“ Detection accuracy may be affected in real-world conditions due to lighting, weather, or animal behavior.
- **Basic Hardware Setup** â€“ Requires durability upgrades for outdoor farm use.
- **Wi-Fi Dependency** â€“ May not be reliable in remote farm areas without strong connectivity.
